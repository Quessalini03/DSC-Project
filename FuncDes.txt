bool checkPrecedence(string tmp, int counter, bool& condition, bool& check, bool& checkBrace, bool& firstOp, bool& firstOp2, bool& temp)
Input: a string, an integer, six references for six bool variables.
Output: True if there is a precedence error, otherwise false.
Description:
	-If tmp[counter] is '*' or '/' operator, "check" will be set to true. If it is '+' or '-' operator, "check" will be set to false 
	("check" will act as a reminder)
	- If expressions having operators with the same level of order appear consecutively, meaning "check" will be set to the same 
	value twice, function will return true, else return false.
	- Variable "temp" can be considered the second bool, with temp = 0 at the beginnin of tmp or when tmp[counter] is ')', otherwise temp > 0.
	Used to prevent the case of check having the same value as before the expression, resulting the function incorrectly returning true.

-------------------------------------

bool checkBlank(string str)
Input: a string
Output: True if there is a blank error, otherwise false.
Description:
	- Function loops from the beginning to the end of str.
	- If a digit is encountered, the bool variable "check" will be set to true. If an operator or '.' is encountered, "check" will be set to false
	("check" will act as a reminder). 
	- If a space ' ' is encountered and "check" is true, function will check the next character. If it is a digit, function will return true
	- After the loop, function will return false as there are no blank errors.
